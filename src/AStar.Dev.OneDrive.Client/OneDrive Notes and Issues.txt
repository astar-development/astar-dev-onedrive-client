1st sync leaces the "Start Sync" button on the overlay as active with the "Start Sync" text when it should change to "Pause Sync"
"Scanning for changes..." is static whilst scanning the content of the folder. If a large folder, the scan could take a considerable amount of time and make the user think nothing is happening / app has hung. Can we add the spinner used elsewhere or is there a better option?
